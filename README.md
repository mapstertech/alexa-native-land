# Getting started

You will need to create several developer accounts:
 - [Amazon developer account](https://developer.amazon.com//)
 - [Google maps Geocoding API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro)
   - The geocoding API is used to translate postal codes from the addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates for the Native Land api

# New Alexa skill

Head to the [Alexa skills kit](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/) and click on `Start a Skill`

*screenshot here*

You are now in the ASK (Alexa skills kit) developer console.
Here you can view, manage, update, delete, and create your Alexa skills.

Create a new skill by clicking `Create Skill`

*screenshot here*

Give your skill a name.

On the next page select `Custom` and click `Create skill`

# Alexa Skills Kit developer console
Welcome to the ASK dev console, you will spend a lot of time here.
*SS*

This is where you configure the permisions your Alexa skill requires, build the app for the Alexa skills library, and configure `Intents`.

### Invocation

First lets configure the `invocation`. The `invocation` is what you will say to "invoke" your Alexa skill.
> "Alexa, ask `Mapster Tutorial` to say hello world"

Or

> "Alexa, open `Mapster Tuorial`"

On the left menu bar click on `Invocation` and enter the words you will say to invoke your skill.
When you have decided, remember to click save at the top of the console area.

### Intents & Utterances

Intents are what Alexa uses to determine what to do after you invoke a skill.
> "Alexa, ask `Mapster Tutorial` to say hello world"

Utterances are words or a phrase a user might say to launch a specific intent
- Alexa listens for `Utterances` after the `Invocation` to determine what to do (What is your intent?)

> "Alexa, ask Mapster Tutorial to `say hello world`"

In this example, the `intent` is `HelloWorldIntent` and the `utterance` is `say hello world`.
- In our "Alexa code" we will set up a listener for HelloWorldIntent to handle this intent i.e. send back "Hello, world."

Let's configure our first intent.
- On the left menu bar next to the word `Intents` click the blue plus âž• symbol to add a new `Intent`
- You can name an intent whatever you like as long it complies with Amazon's intent rules
- I named mine `HelloWorldIntent`
- Think of some words or phrases a user may say to launch the `Hello world intent` we have created, or copy and paste mine. These are the `Utterances`.
```
say hello
say hi
hi
hello
say hello world
hello world
play me the song of our people
```

### Permissions
Permissions can be configured from the left menu bar.

We will need permission to:

>Device Address: Country & Postal Code Only

### Next steps
1. Save the model!! *VERY IMPORTANT*. You will lose your changes if you do not save.

*SS*

2. Go back to the `Alexa Skills Console` and copy the ridculously small Alexa skill key.
    - This is a unique device key, and your Lambda function requires it as a config
